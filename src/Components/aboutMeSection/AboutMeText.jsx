      <p>
       I am a passionate web developer with strong skills in backend development using Laravel and in-depth knowledge of PHP. I also have experience working with frontend technologies, including React, along with a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to build clean, responsive, and interactive user interfaces.

In addition to Laravel and PHP, I have basic knowledge of MongoDB and Express.js, and I am familiar with the MERN stack, which helps me understand full-stack application development.

I also have a good foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and have studied Data Structures using C and C++, which strengthens my problem-solving and programming logic.

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving real-world problems through code, and constantly improving my skills to keep up with the latest trends in web development.
